# ðŸŒŒ N-Body Problem Simulation

This project simulates the gravitational interactions between multiple bodies using Newton's law of universal gravitation. It's a classic problem in computational physics, illustrating how celestial bodies influence each other's motion over time.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Gravitational interaction between N bodies
- Configurable initial masses, positions, and velocities
- Visualization of orbits and interactions
- Output saved as a `.gif` of the simulation
